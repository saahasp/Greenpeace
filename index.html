        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          The Great Smog in 1952 killed 8000 people in London. This event was caused by a period of cold weather combined with windless conditions that formed a dense layer of airborne pollutants, mostly from coal plants, over the city. Beginning about 1000 CE, the use of coal for fuel caused considerable air pollution, and the conversion of coal to coke for iron smelting beginning in the 17th century exacerbated the problem. In Europe, from the Middle Ages well into the early modern era, unsanitary urban conditions favored the outbreak of population-decimating epidemics of disease, from plague to cholera and typhoid fever. Through the 19th century, water and air pollution and the accumulation of solid wastes were largely problems of congested urban areas. But, with the rapid spread of industrialization and the growth of the human population to unprecedented levels, pollution became a universal problem. Other persistent chemicals that accumulate in the food chain and disrupt the natural balance of ecosystems on a wide scale. Noxious levels of air pollution are common in many large cities, where particulates and gasses from transportation, heating, and manufacturing accumulate and linger. The problem of plastic pollution on land and in the oceans has only grown as the use of single-use plastics has burgeoned worldwide. In addition, greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane and carbon dioxide, continue to drive global warming and pose a great threat to biodiversity and public health.

        <h2>About Greenpeace</h2>
        <p>
          The Greenpeace interest group has many different methods and strategies that all aim to make the planet more green and safer for everyone. They peacefully protest and directly approach government authorities and polluting corporations in order to bring attention to environmental pollution and try to reduce it. Along with preventing environmental abuses this group also aims to preserve endangered animal species across the globe.

        <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Significant environmental campaigning accomplishments have been made by Greenpeace. They have actively backed laws passed all around the world, including the Forest Rights Act, the Climate Action Now Act, and the European Union's ban on single-use plastics. In 1974, they overcame France and put an end to their atmospheric nuclear tests off the coast of Alaska as their first success. Greenpeace has submitted amicus curiae briefs in favor of environmental issues, although they are not actively involved in Supreme Court cases. For example, in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency in 2007, they supported Massachusetts' position for EPA control of greenhouse gas emissions. As a non-profit, Greenpeace depends on membership fees, grants, and individual contributions for revenue. Their expenditures encompass a range of activities, such as research, public awareness campaigns, direct actions, and environmental advocacy, with a focus on issues like renewable energy promotion, deforestation prevention, and climate change awareness.
